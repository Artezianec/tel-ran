    <p>An early study suggested that the fold is inherited as an autosomal dominant trait.[8] A later study suggested an
        incomplete dominance.[9] A cat with folded ears may have either one (heterozygous) or two copies (homozygous) of
        the dominant fold gene (Fd). A cat with normal ears should have two copies of the normal gene (fd).</p>

    <p>Mating a homozygous fold with any cat will produce all folds, but because homozygous folds are prone to severe
        health issues, breeding for them is generally considered unethical. A homozygous to normal mating will produce
        only heterozygous folds but presumably in ethical breeding programs, there will be no homozygous cats available
        to breed from. </p>

    <p>The only generally accepted breeding gives a 50% chance of producing heterozygous folds and 50% chance of
        producing progeny with normal genes.</p>

    <p>There is suspicion that some non-fold litters are genetically heterozygous folds but because of very low
        expression of the gene, appear to be straight-eared. Such kittens may develop folded ears initially which then
        straighten back out. Because of this there are suggestions by some breeders to avoid mating Folds with
        straight-eared Scottish Folds but only use British Shorthairs (BSH) as outcross.[10][11] If Scottish Shorthairs
        are to be used, they should be test mated to a BSH to make sure that they are not genetically folds.[10] If such
        apparent straight-eared cats are mated with a fold, there is a 75% chance of folds (25% homozygous folds, 50%
        heterozygous folds) and 25% chance of straight ears. </p>
    <p>In 2016 the genetic mutation responsible for the folded ears and the OCD was identified. It was found in a gene
        encoding a calcium permeable ion channel, transient receptor potential cation channel, subfamily V, member 4
        (TRPV4).[12] The mutation is a V342F substitution (c.1024G>T) in the fifth ankyrin repeat within the N-terminal
        cytoplasmic domain. It was also found in a human patient with metatropic dysplasia.[13] </p>
