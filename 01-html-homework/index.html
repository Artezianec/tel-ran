    <p>The Scottish Fold is a breed of domestic cat with a natural dominant gene mutation that affects cartilage
        throughout the body, causing the ears to "fold", bending forward and down towards the front of the head, which
        gives the cat what is often described as an "owl-like" appearance.

        Originally called lop-eared or lops after the lop-eared rabbit, Scottish Fold became the breed's name in
        1966.[1] Depending on registries, longhaired Scottish Folds are varyingly known as Highland Fold, Scottish Fold
        Longhair, Longhair Fold and Coupari.</p>
