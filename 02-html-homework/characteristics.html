    <h2>Ears</h2>
    <p>Scottish Fold kittens that do not develop folded ears are known as Scottish Straights.[1] The original cats only
        had one fold in their ears, but due to selective breeding, breeders have increased the fold to a double or
        triple crease that causes the ear to lie totally flat against the head.</p>
    <p>The breed's distinctive folded ears are produced by an incompletely dominant gene that affects the cartilage of
        the ears, causing the ears to fold forward and downward, giving a cap-like appearance to the head. Smaller,
        tightly folded ears set in a cap-like fashion are preferred to a loose fold and larger ear. The large, round
        eyes and rounded head, cheeks, and whisker pads add to the overall rounded appearance. Despite the folded ears,
        folds still use their aural appendages to express themselves—the ears swivel to listen, lie back in anger and
        prick up when the treat bag rustles.</p>
    <h2>Body</h2>
    <p>The Scottish Fold is a medium-sized cat, usually ash in color. Males typically weigh 4–6 kg (8.8–13.2 lb), and
        females weigh 2.7–4 kg (6.0–8.8 lb). The Fold's entire body structure, especially the head and face, is
        generally rounded, and the eyes large and round. The nose is short with a gentle curve, and the cat's body is
        well-rounded with a padded look and medium-to-short legs. The head is domed at the top, and the neck very short.
        The broadly-spaced eyes give the Scottish Fold a "sweet expression".[4] The scottish fold's ears are folded
        hence the name "Scottish Fold".</p>
    <h2>Coat</h2>
    <p>Scottish Folds can be either long- or short-haired, and they may have nearly any coat color or combination of
        colours (including white).[4] Shorthair Scottish Folds have thick and soft fur, with longhair Folds having
        longer and exceptionally dense fur around their upper thighs, toes, ears, and tail.[6] </p>
    <h2>Temperament</h2>
    <p>Scottish Folds, whether with folded ears or with normal ears, are typically good-natured and placid and adjust to
        other animals within a household extremely well. They tend to become very attached to their human caregivers and
        are by nature quite affectionate. Folds also receive high marks for playfulness, grooming and intelligence.
        Scottish Folds like to be outdoors and enjoy outdoor games and activities. Loneliness is something they heavily
        dislike. It is also common for Scottish Folds to be stubborn. </p>
    <h2>Habits</h2>
    <p>Folds are also known for sleeping on their backs.[4] Scottish Folds typically have soft voices and display a
        complex repertoire of meows and purrs not found in better-known breeds. Folds are also known for sitting with
        their legs stretched out and their paws on their belly. This position is called the "Buddha Position".[7] </p>
