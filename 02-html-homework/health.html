    <p>The typical lifespan of a Scottish Fold is 15 years.<br>

        Scottish folds are susceptible to polycystic kidney disease (PKD)[14] and cardiomyopathy.[15] Scottish folds are
        also prone to degenerative joint disease (a type of arthritis), most commonly affecting the tail, ankles, and
        knees which can result in reduced range of motion.</p>
    <h2>Osteochondrodysplasia</h2>
    <p>Osteochondrodysplasia (OCD) is a developmental abnormality that affects cartilage and bone development throughout
        the body. This condition causes the ear fold in the breed and, in studies conducted so far, all Fold cats are
        affected by it.[16] Homozygous Folds are affected by malformed bone structures and develop severe painful
        degenerative joint diseases at an early age. This condition also affects heterozygous Folds, but usually to a
        much lesser extent and at a later age. Some will be asymptomatic.<br>

        While ethical breeders breed Fold/non-Fold and not Fold/Fold (in the same way Munchkins are bred) to avoid
        producing homozygous Folds,[4] because heterozygous Folds can also develop progressive arthritis of varying
        severity, some researchers recommend abandoning the breeding of Fold cats entirely.[8][17] For this reason, the
        breed is not accepted by either the Governing Council of the Cat Fancy[18] or the Fédération Internationale
        Féline (FIFe).<br>

        CFA breeders have stated that using only Fold to non-Fold breeding has eliminated problems with stiff tails,
        shortened tails and bone lesions.[1] In the FIFe discussion, the representative for British breeders claimed
        that they were not seeing the problem in their cats, and that the study which showed that all heterozygous also
        have the condition had a small sample size. An offer of free X-ray radiography was presented to 300 breeders to
        find a Fold cat with healthy hind legs, but it was never taken up.[20][21] A similar offer was set up by the
        World Cat Federation together with researcher Leslie Lyons but there was also no response. FiFe stated that they
        will not consider recognizing Scottish Folds if breeders will not allow their breed to be scrutinized.<br>

        In a report on Scottish Folds, the Breed Standards Advisory Council (BSAC) for New Zealand Cat Fancy (NZCF)
        states that "Breeders may not have appreciated the strength of the evidence that heterozygous cats can and do
        develop [feline] OCD." While research shows that all heterozygous Folds develop OCD, and anecdotal evidence
        shows that heterozygous Folds can and do develop OCD, they do not show whether mildly affected parents are more
        likely to have mildly affected offspring. They also do not show what percentage of Folds are severely affected.
        The report states that there is not enough information to justify banning Scottish Fold matings, but enough to
        justify a level of concern.[10] Recommended guidelines include:<br>

        A requirement for periodic vet examination of breeding cats for any evidence of lameness, stiffness, or pain —
        breeding cats with signs to be desexed.<br>
        A requirement for periodic X-rays of breeding cats and comparison of X-ray evidence with clinical symptoms,
        possibly leading to a requirement that cats with a specified degree of skeletal change to be desexed.<br>
        Requesting the agreement of pet owners to be periodically contacted by the NZCF or by a researcher, to provide
        reports about the health of their cat.<br>
        All information to be reported/submitted to the BSAC to allow information to be collated to give an overall
        picture of FOCD in Scottish Folds in NZ.<br>
        Requirements to be in place for a minimum of 5 years to enable tracking of the health of Folds over time.</p>
